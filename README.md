# Simple yt-dlp
A python software to download mp4 and mp3 using yt-dlp


install the libraries from requirements.txt and start the python script or just use the executable from the release page to make it work


the executable is falsely detected as a malware, it's most likely due to the use of pyinstaller which is sometime falsely detected as malware, it is a very common problem and the only way to fix it is for me to send the file to anti-virus companies for them to approve my software and i'm too lazy to do it


i think the mp4 is sometimes not downloaded as highest quality . this is because ffmpeg is not used in this project (it takes to much space) thus resulting in the mp4 not being downloaded at maximum quality


the commits added after the latest release are just readme updates and things such as added comments in the python files and changed variable names to make it more readable


Btw sorry for my bad english, i'm french


the software is in french and licensed under the apache license version 2.0.

feel free to do a pull request or issue if there is a problem with the executable or python script
