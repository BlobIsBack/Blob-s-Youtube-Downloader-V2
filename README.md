# Blob-s-Youtube-Downloader-V2
A python script to download youtube mp4 and mp3


install the libraries from requirements.txt or just use the executable from the release page to make it work


the executable is falsely detected as a malware, it's most likely due to the use of pyinstaller which is sometime used to compile malware, thus resulting in windows defender and other anti viruses as automatically detecting any executable made with pyinstaller. this file is 100% safe you can compile it yourself if you want. to use it put the original file or archive in a folder and add it to your anti virus as white list.


i think the mp4 quality is a bit limited. this is because ffmpeg is not used in this project (it takes to much space) thus resulting in maximum quality being hd 720p
i'm not 100% sure it's limited to 720p but it is likely that it is


Btw sorry for my bad english, i'm french


the software is in french and licensed under the apache license version 2.0
