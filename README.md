# Blob-s-Youtube-Downloader-V2
A python script to download youtube mp4 and mp3



install the libraries from requirements.txt to make it work



the download.py is the downloader



the executable is falsely detected as a malware, it's most likely due to the use of pyinstaller which is sometime used to compile malware, thus resulting in windows defender and other anti viruses as automatically detecting any executable made with pyinstaller. this file is 100% safe you can compile it yourself if you want. to use it put the .zip file in a folder and add it to your anti virus as white list. the executable has "lucas's youtube downloader" as windows name, it's because i forgot to remove my name from the code before compiling it



the software is in french
